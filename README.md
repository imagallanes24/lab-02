## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: There was a huge change in the reliability of UDP. The 50% loss to my local environment had the UDP making mistakes. It was not responding as fast and making mistakes in numbers it was sending back. I believe the 50% loss to my local environment causes the change.

Answer for Question 2: The reliability of TCP changed with the 50% loss to my local environment. It was lowered, making mistakes on the data it was sending and receiving.

Answer for Question 3: The TCP was not responding as fast either. It was way slower with the 50% loss to my local environment.
